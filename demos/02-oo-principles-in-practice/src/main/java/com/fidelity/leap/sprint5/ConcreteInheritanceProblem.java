// Step 1 of the story: inheriting from a CONCRETE class (not abstract yet).
// These three classes are deliberately non-public and live in one file together -
// they only exist to set up the problem Instrument.java (the abstract version)
// then fixes. Nothing here is part of the lab.

// A concrete class - it CAN be instantiated directly (new ConcreteInstrument(...)
// is legal), and calculateFee() has a real, default implementation.
class ConcreteInstrument {

    private final String ticker;

    ConcreteInstrument(String ticker) {
        this.ticker = ticker;

    // A "default" fee: 0.1% of trade value. Reasonable for an equity, but this is
    // only a guess at what most subclasses will want - nothing forces a subclass
    // to actually override it.
    double calculateFee(double tradeValue) {
        return tradeValue * 0.001;
    }
}

// This override happens to be correct for an equity's fee.
class EquityInstrumentV1 extends ConcreteInstrument {
    EquityInstrumentV1(String ticker) {
        super(ticker);
    }
    // (No override needed - the inherited default already matches what an
    // equity's fee should be. This alone should feel a little too convenient.)
}

// THE BUG: bonds should charge a flat $5.00 fee, not a percentage. Whoever wrote
// this class forgot to override calculateFee() - and the compiler said nothing,
// because ConcreteInstrument's calculateFee() is a real, callable method, not a
// requirement. This class silently, incorrectly inherits the equity-style
// percentage fee instead.
